# PCDS Pitch Video Script (3 Minutes)
## Simplified for Maximum Impact

---

## ⏱️ 0:00–0:30 — YOU + PROBLEM (Face on camera)

**[Camera ON - Your face visible, no slides yet]**

> "Hi, I'm [Your Name] from [University].
>
> Every 39 seconds, a cyber attack happens somewhere in the world.
>
> But here's what most people don't know: **60% of small businesses that get breached... shut down within 6 months.**
>
> The tools they use? They only react *after* the damage is done. By then, it's too late.
>
> We built something different."

## ⏱️ 0:30–1:15 — THE SOLUTION (Show Solution slide)

**[Switch to Slide 4 - Solution]**

> "This is PCDS — a **Predictive** Cyber Defence System.
>
> Instead of waiting for attacks to happen, we **predict** them.
>
> How? We trained a 5-model machine learning ensemble on over 5 million real attack samples. It detects behavioral anomalies in real-time — patterns that signal an attack is coming.
>
> When it detects a threat? Automatic isolation. No human delay. No waiting for a security analyst to wake up.
>
> And because small business owners aren't security experts, we built an AI Copilot — powered by Azure OpenAI — that explains every threat in plain English."

## ⏱️ 1:15–2:00 — THE PROOF (Show Performance slide)

**[Switch to Slide 6 - Validated Performance]**

> "This isn't a concept. This is tested.
>
> We achieved **88.3% detection accuracy** on the CICIDS2017 benchmark dataset.
>
> Under **2 milliseconds** latency — fast enough for real-time protection.
>
> And less than **3% false positives** — because shutting down a business by mistake is just as bad as missing an attack.
>
> All of this runs on Microsoft Azure. Azure OpenAI for natural language. Azure infrastructure for scale."

## ⏱️ 2:00–2:40 — WHY IT MATTERS (Show Roadmap briefly)

**[Switch to Slide 7 - Roadmap]**

> "Right now, elite cybersecurity costs $50,000 to $100,000 a year. That's out of reach for 99% of businesses.
>
> We're changing that.
>
> PCDS delivers **enterprise-grade protection at a price small businesses can afford.**
>
> Our goal? Give organizations **hours or days of warning** instead of minutes. Turn cybersecurity from reactive... to predictive."

---

## ⏱️ 2:40–3:00 — CLOSE STRONG (Face back on camera)

**[Camera ON - Your face visible]**

> "PCDS turns security from reaction... into prevention.
>
> We're built on Azure. We're ready to scale. And we're ready to protect the businesses that power our economy.
>
> Thank you."
