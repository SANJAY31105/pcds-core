Hi, I'm Sanjay.

This is PCDS – our Azure-powered predictive cyber defense system
for small and medium businesses
that can't afford a 50,000-dollar security stack.

---

This is the PCDS dashboard for a 20-employee clinic.

You can see the overall risk score,
active threats,
and status in one place.

Now I'll replay a real brute-force login attack.

As the traffic hits our environment,
PCDS analyzes it in real time
and raises a high-risk alert for this server.

---

PCDS ingests telemetry using Azure Monitor
and sends it to a five-model ML ensemble
running on Azure Machine Learning with GPU acceleration.

The ensemble combines XGBoost, Random Forest, and autoencoder models.

It reaches 88 percent detection accuracy
with under 3 percent false positives
and under 2 milliseconds response time.

Most SMB owners are not security experts.

So they use our AI Security Copilot,
powered by Azure OpenAI.

Here the owner asks:
"What happened on my server last night, and do I need to worry?"

The Copilot summarizes the attack in plain English,
explains it was a credential-stuffing attempt,
tells them PCDS already blocked it,
and recommends simple next steps.

---

When a high-severity threat is predicted,
PCDS automatically runs a response playbook
using Azure Functions.

You can see this node being isolated,
the malicious IP blocked,
and alerts sent to the team
in under two milliseconds.

No human in the loop.

Every incident is mapped on a kill-chain timeline
and tagged to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

The owner can export a PDF report
for compliance with one click.

---

PCDS turns reactive security into predictive defense for SMBs.

By combining Azure Monitor, Azure ML, Azure Functions,
Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure SQL, and Azure OpenAI,
we give small businesses enterprise-level protection
starting at 99 dollars a month.

Thank you.
