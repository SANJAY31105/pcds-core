# SLIDE 1: TITLE

## **PCDS**
### Predictive Cyber Defence System

*"Stop attacks before they start"*

**Team:** [Your Names]
**Category:** Cybersecurity
**Powered by:** Microsoft Azure AI

# SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM (Emotional + Financial)

## **Every 39 seconds, a business loses $4.45 million to a cyberattack they never saw coming.**

### The Pain:
- 🔴 **$4.45M** average cost of a data breach (IBM 2024)
- 🔴 **277 days** average time to identify a breach
- 🔴 **65%** of security analysts experience burnout
- 🔴 **10,000+** daily alerts → 95% ignored

### The Root Cause:
> **"Traditional security tools are REACTIVE. They tell you what happened—after the damage is done."**

---

# SLIDE 3: REAL-WORLD SCENARIO

## **Colonial Pipeline: May 2021**

📍 **2:47 AM** — Attacker with stolen VPN password enters network
📍 **Next 6 hours** — 100GB encrypted, SIEM silent
📍 **Morning** — 45% of East Coast fuel supply offline
📍 **Ransom paid:** $4.4 million

### What if their system saw this coming **before execution**?

*That's what PCDS is building.*

# SLIDE 5: WHAT PCDS DOES TODAY vs WHAT SCALES NEXT

## ✅ What PCDS Does TODAY (Proven)

| Capability | Status | Evidence |
|------------|--------|----------|
| Early-stage phishing detection | ✅ Working | 88.3% accuracy on 2.95M samples |
| Lateral movement pattern recognition | ✅ Working | UNSW-NB15 validated |
| Azure OpenAI threat explanations | ✅ Working | Live demo available |
| Kill chain visualization | ✅ Working | MITRE ATT&CK mapped |
| 1.9ms detection latency | ✅ Working | E2E tested |

## 🔜 What Scales NEXT (Roadmap)

| Capability | Timeline | Dependency |
|------------|----------|------------|
| Full probabilistic attack forecasting | Q2 2026 | More training data |
| Cross-tenant threat intelligence | Q3 2026 | Enterprise pilots |
| Automated remediation playbooks | Q4 2026 | SOC partnerships |

*We're honest about where we are—that's how we earn trust.*

---

# SLIDE 6: WHAT WE CHOSE NOT TO DO (Trade-offs)

## Engineering decisions that matter:

### ✅ We prioritized **low false positives** over maximum recall
> *"Better to miss 1 attack than alert on 1,000 false positives. SOC teams are already drowning."*

### ✅ We chose **explainability** over black-box accuracy
> *"A 95% accurate model is worthless if analysts can't understand why it flagged something."*

### ✅ We avoid **automated destructive actions**
> *"PCDS recommends, humans decide. We never auto-quarantine without approval."*

### ✅ We don't predict zero-days—by design
> *"Zero-days require behavioral anomaly, not pattern matching. That's our Year 2 focus."*

*We know what we're good at. And what we're not. Yet.*

# SLIDE 7: MICROSOFT AZURE — WHY THIS ONLY WORKS BECAUSE OF MICROSOFT

## PCDS is a natural extension of Microsoft's security ecosystem

| Azure Service | Why It's Essential |
|---------------|-------------------|
| **Azure OpenAI (GPT-4)** | Explainability that SOC analysts trust |
| **Azure Machine Learning** | Enterprise-grade model deployment |
| **Azure Identity** | Trust boundary for multi-tenant security |
| **Azure Kubernetes** | Global SOC readiness at scale |

### The Honest Truth:
> *"Without Microsoft Azure, PCDS would be a research project. Azure made it enterprise-ready."*

# SLIDE 8: ONE HERO MOMENT — KILL CHAIN VISUALIZER

## Watch PCDS stop an attack mid-chain

```
[Recon] → [Initial Access] → [Execution] → [Persistence] → [BLOCKED]
   ↓           ↓                ↓              ↓
 Detected   Flagged         Alerted      ← SOAR triggered
```

### Demo Flow (2 minutes):
1. Attacker begins reconnaissance
2. PCDS ML flags unusual DNS patterns
3. Kill Chain Visualizer shows attack progression
4. Azure OpenAI explains the threat
5. SOAR recommends isolation—human approves
6. **Attack stopped at Stage 4 of 7**

*If judges remember one thing, it's this visualization.*

# SLIDE 9: ML MODEL PERFORMANCE (Real Numbers)

## *Tested on 5.5M+ samples from two industry-standard datasets:*
- **UNSW-NB15** (2015) - 2.95M network intrusion samples
- **CICIDS 2017** - 2.8M attack scenario samples

| Metric | PCDS | Industry Avg |
|--------|------|--------------|
| Accuracy | **88.3%** | 78% |
| Precision | **90.7%** | 75% |
| False Positive Rate | **2.8%** | 15% |
| Detection Latency | **1.9ms** | 50ms+ |
| Training Dataset | **5.5M+ samples** | Varies |

### 5-Model Ensemble:
1. LSTM Sequence Detector (Deep Learning)
2. Random Forest Classifier (Feature-based)
3. Isolation Forest (Anomaly Detection)
4. Behavioral Analyzer (UEBA)
5. DGA Detector CNN (Domain Analysis)

*All metrics validated on public datasets — fully reproducible*

# SLIDE 10: WHY TRADITIONAL TOOLS FAIL

## They were built for a different era

| Era | Tool Type | Philosophy |
|-----|-----------|------------|
| 2000s | **SIEMs** | Log-centric — "Store everything, search later" |
| 2010s | **XDRs** | Detection-centric — "Find the known bad" |
| 2020s | **PCDS** | Decision-centric — "Predict before it happens" |

### The Problem with Competitors:
- **Darktrace**: Amazing at detection, but reactive by design
- **CrowdStrike**: Excellent EDR, but endpoint-focused
- **Vectra**: Strong NDR, but no predictive layer

### Our Position:
> *We're not replacing them. We're the predictive layer they're missing.*

---

# SLIDE 11: ETHICS & RESPONSIBLE AI

## How PCDS aligns with Microsoft's AI principles

### Human-in-the-Loop
> *"PCDS recommends actions. Humans approve them. Always."*

### Explainability Before Enforcement
> *"Every alert includes Azure OpenAI explanation. No black boxes."*

### No Automated Destructive Actions
> *"We will never auto-delete files or kill processes without human approval."*

### Privacy by Design
> *"Threat analysis happens on-premise. Only anonymized telemetry reaches cloud."*

*This is how we earn enterprise trust.*
