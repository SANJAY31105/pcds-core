Hi, I'm Sanjay from [Your University].

Every 39 seconds, a cyber attack happens somewhere in the world.

But here's what most people don't know: 
60% of small businesses that get breached... 
shut down within 6 months.

The tools they use? 
They only react *after* the damage is done. 
By then, it's too late.

We built something different.

This is PCDS — a Predictive Cyber Defence System.

Instead of waiting for attacks to happen, 
we predict them.

How? 
We trained a 5-model machine learning ensemble 
on over 5 million real attack samples. 

It detects behavioral anomalies in real-time — 
patterns that signal an attack is coming.

When it detects a threat? 
Automatic isolation. 
No human delay. 
No waiting for a security analyst to wake up.

And because small business owners aren't security experts, 
we built an AI Copilot — powered by Azure OpenAI — 
that explains every threat in plain English.

This isn't a concept. This is tested.

We achieved 88.3% detection accuracy 
on the CICIDS2017 benchmark dataset.

Under 2 milliseconds latency — 
fast enough for real-time protection.

And less than 3% false positives — 
because shutting down a business by mistake 
is just as bad as missing an attack.

All of this runs on Microsoft Azure. 
Azure OpenAI for natural language. 
Azure infrastructure for scale.

Right now, elite cybersecurity costs 
$50,000 to $100,000 a year. 
That's out of reach for 99% of businesses.

We're changing that.

PCDS delivers enterprise-grade protection 
at a price small businesses can afford.

Our goal? 
Give organizations hours or days of warning 
instead of minutes. 
Turn cybersecurity from reactive... 
to predictive.

PCDS turns security from reaction... 
into prevention.

We're built on Azure. 
We're ready to scale. 
And we're ready to protect the businesses 
that power our economy.

Thank you.
